## Requirements

It makes use of the [Zstandard library](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/). You don't need to install it by yourself if you choose to install bgen via [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html) but you do need it installed before-hand if you choose to build bgen library by yourself. It also makes use of the [almosthere library](https://github.com/horta/almosthere) for showing progress while performing time-consuming tasks:

- [zstd install](https://github.com/horta/zstd.install)
- [zlib install](https://github.com/horta/zlib.install)
- [almosthere install](https://github.com/horta/almosthere)

## Install

You can install it via `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge bgen
```

A second installation option would be to download the latest source and to build it by yourself. On Linux or macOS systems it can be as simple as:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/limix/bgen/master/install)
```

Similarly, on Windows you can install by entering in the terminal:

```powershell
powershell -Command "(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/limix/bgen/master/install.bat', 'install.bat')" && install.bat
```

assuming that you have both zlib (often the case) and Zstandard (usually not the case) libraries installed and that [cmake](https://cmake.org/) managed to find them without any hint. If you do have those libraries installed but `cmake` did not manage to find them, you can specify their location to `cmake` as:

    cmake .. -DZLIB_ROOT="/path/to/zlib/dir" \
             -DZSTD_LIBRARYDIR="/path/to/zstd/lib/dir" \
             -DZSTD_INCLUDEDIR="/path/to/zstd/header/dir"

## Documentation

Refer to [documentation](https://bgen.readthedocs.io/) for usage and API description.

## File specification

The original specification can be found at [http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/).
We have also created an alternative, more [user-friendly BGEN specification](bgen-file-format.pdf).
